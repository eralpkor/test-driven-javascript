How does tiny test works:
This is an in-browser JavaScript library I've been using for years. It's so small and simple that it never occured to me to open source it until I saw all the overly complicated alternatives that are out there.

If you're looking for a JavaScript library full of features or install guides that say things like grunt, npm or bower, you've come to the wrong place. Sorry, this probably isn't for you. Move along now.

If you're looking for a quick way to unit-test a JavaScript function/object in a web-page and don't want to get bogged down in frameworks, you've come to the right place. Take a seat... no scratch that, you'll have everything you need in a few seconds so you may as well remain standing.

Let's say you have a function in adder.js:

  return a + b;
}
